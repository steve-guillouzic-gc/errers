Changed
------- 
- Change name of application from DeLaTeXify to ERRERS. Change suffix of output
  files from "dy" to "err". Update icon. Rename "conversion" as "extraction".
- Create automatic rules for environments created using \\newenvironment and
  \\renewenvironment commands.
- Create automatic rules for \\the... commands of new counters.
- Amend rules for tikzpicture so labels defined using label and pin options are
  also kept.
- When an exception is raised, log location in hierarchy of rules and patterns,
  if applicable.
- Add vertical space between input and output fields in GUI. Set background of
  input field to white, and write "Click here to select input file." into the
  field when a file has not yet been selected.
- In GUI, label "Extract" button as "Error" rather than "Done" when an error
  occurs.
- Add "location" phase to extraction, applied when files are read and
  responsible for taking note of location of LaTeX command definitions (file
  name and line number).
- When creating rules automatically for LaTeX commands, add a rule that uses
  default value of optional argument when appropriate.
- Omit Microsoft Visual Studio files from bundled application. This requires
  the installation of either Visual Studio or "Microsoft Visual C++ 2015
  Redistributable" package to run application.
- Keep atomic groups and possessive quantifiers in patterns and substitution
  rules when using re module with Python 3.11.5 or later. (They were previously
  kept only when using the regex module.)

Fixed
-----
- Process optional argument of \\definecolor.
- Fix bug that led to node labels with more than one level of internal curly
  brackets to being dropped when using re module.
- Fix bug that led to erroneous removal of bracketed content immediately
  following \\begin{figure} or \\begin{table}.
- Move rule for \\i before accents rules to allow proper composition.
- Catch and log error when attempting to insert secondary file into main LaTeX
  document read from memory.
- Replace %C placeholder by %c after optional %s to avoid matching opening
  square bracket when using re module and mandatory argument contains more than
  one level of internal curly brackets. Similarly replace %C by %c in rules for
  tikzpicture environment.
- In DRDC documents, omit pre-defined values for future distribution (such as
  goc, dnd, and drdc).
- In DRDC documents, add space after establishment name in list of authors.
- Wrap input path when longer than width of input field.
- Accept optional version argument of \\usepackage command, which comes after
  the package name.
- In rule for \\hypersetup command, allow spaces before equal sign in key-value
  pairs. Also recognize a larger number of keywords.
- Fix bug in automatic creation of rules for LaTeX commands with optional
  argument.
- Fix bug in \\newcounter rule (leftover Vim regular-expression specifier).
- While the %n placeholder matches at most one newline character, allow it to
  match an arbitrary number of lines composed solely of comments.
- Remove white space from around the argument of \\footnote, \\footnotetext,
  \\marginpar, and \\thanks commands, as well as the commenting commands of the
  fixme package, before placing it in parentheses.
- Fix bug in \\tbl rule for interact document class.
- In booktabs package, make trimming argument of \\cmidrule command optional.

- Referring to capturing groups by index in replacement patterns no longer
  supported when using %c, %C, %s, and %r placeholders.

- Remove call to Path.with_stem method in processing of "Copy Log" button,
  because it was introduced in Python 3.9.
- Remove white padding on left and right sides of shortcut window.
- Process rules for math environments earlier (setup phase rather than main) to
  prevent automatic rules from inserting dollar signs into them before their
  removal.
- Fix output of number of matches to times file.
- Replace \\i with a regular i rather than a dot-less i, because the latter
  does not compose properly with accents.
- Move rules for \\url command to removal phase so URLs with % characters are
  processed correctly.
- Omit space before percent signs to avoid issues in URLs.
- Modify rules for printing glossaries and indexes so all entries are printed
  with re module even when more than two levels of curly braces are present.
- Fix bug in default rule for one-argument commands that made it match the
  first argument of multi-argument commands when using re module.
- Replace \\clearpage, \\cleardoublepage, and \\newpage by two newlines rather
  than just removing them.

  Microsoft Word.

  matching patterns (%o = stem of output file name).

Changed
-------
- Replace "Shortcuts" button with separate application.

  \\newcommand, \\renewcommand, and \\ensurecommand.

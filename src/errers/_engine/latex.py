"""ERRERS: custom interface to regular expressions (plain rules)

All elements of this module are implementation details that may change in
non-backward-compatible ways between minor or micro version releases.

The create_classes function of the latex module returns Pattern, Rule and
RuleList classes, which provide latex-specific pattern elements (such as %c and
%n). See documentation of LaTeXMixIn class for more information.

Metaclasses:
    MetaBrackets -- function object providing bracket pair matching for
        Pattern instances
    LaTeXMixin -- regular expression pattern extended for matching LaTeX code
    KeyValueMixin -- provide class method returning rule to extract key-value
        parameters

Function:
    create_classes -- create classes for patterns, rules and rule lists

The following elements are internal elements of the module.

Constants:
    _TEMPLATE_CRS_RE -- template for %c, %r and %s search patterns (re
        module)
    _TEMPLATE_CRS_REGEX -- template for %c, %r and %s search patterns (regex
        module)
    _TEMPLATE_C_RE -- template for %C search pattern (re module)
    _TEMPLATE_C_REGEX -- template for %C search pattern (regex module)

class MetaBrackets:
    """Function object providing bracket pair matching for Pattern instances.

    Sub-classes must specify which rule list class to use internally.

    The class provides a function object that replaces %c, %r and %s in regular
    expressions with patterns that match pairs of curly, round and square
    brackets, respectively. The function object also replaces %C with a pattern
    that matches a pair of curly braces or a LaTeX command or a single
    character. The matching is described in more detail in the LaTeXMixin
    documentation. The function object maintains an index of %c/%C, %r and %s
    patterns in order to name the capturing group for the bracketed content,
    for use in a recursive pattern. (The recursive pattern is what enables the
    use of balanced brackets in bracketed content with the regex module.) The
    name of a capturing group can be specified manually by appending an empty
    named group to the %c, %C, %s or %s placeholder, such as in
    '%C(?P<custom_name>)'; the index is not incremented for such placeholders.

    Normally, capturing groups in an alternation---such as in (a)|(b)---have
    the same group number. However, because the capturing groups in the %c/%C,
    %r and %s are named, they always have different group numbers.

class LaTeXMixin:
    r"""Regular expression pattern extended for matching LaTeX code.

    This is a mixin class. Sub-classes must specify the class to use for
    internal rule lists.

    Six changes are made to the pattern:

    1. Three negative lookbehinds are added before the pattern if it starts
    with a command name. The first one ensures that the matched text is not
    just a word or character following a newline (\\); it contains an inner
    negative lookbehind to allow matching commands that immediately follow
    newlines, such as \\\emph{abc}. The second lookbehind prevents matching
    command names in definitions using \newcommand, \renewcommand and
    \providecommand. Asterisks are stripped when files are read, and
    \renewcommand and \providecommand are converted to \newcommand. Therefore,
    the lookbehind pattern only needs to make sure that the command is not the
    first argument to \newcommand. The third lookbehind is similar to the
    second one, but for commands defined using \def, \edef, \gdef and \xdef.

    2. A negative lookahead is added after alphabetic commands that take no
    arguments to ensure that they don't match the beginning of longer commands,
    for instance \abc vs \abcd. The rule also swallows any white space
    following the command (including one newline, if the next line is not
    empty).

    3. The %c, %r and %s strings are replaced with patterns that match pairs of
    curly, round and square brackets with arbitrary content in between. The
    only restriction on the content is that it must not contain unbalanced
    brackets of the type being matched. A %c, %r or %s may be made optional by
    following it with a question mark (?) in the search pattern. Each %c,
    %r and %s counts as a capturing group, and the bracketed content can be
    inserted into replacement strings using named groups
    labelled according to the type of bracket (\g<c1> = content of first pair
    of curly brackets in pattern, \g<s1> = content of first pair of square
    brackets, etc.) Referring to capturing groups by indices (\1, \2, etc.) is
    not supported because (a) the pattern for the %C placeholder uses two
    capturing groups and (b) future bug fixes may require the introduction
    of additional capturing groups for any of the %c, %s, %r and %C
    placeholders. The name of a capturing group can be specified manually by
    appending an empty named group to the %c, %C, %s or %s placeholder (before
    the quantifier if applicable), such as in '%C(?P<myname>)'; the index is
    not incremented for such placeholders. White space before the opening
    bracket is dropped, as well as the one at the beginning and end of the
    bracketed content. With the standard re module, the patterns only match
    pairs of braces that contain no more than one additional level of brackets
    of the type being matched.

    4. The %C string is replaced by a pattern that matches a pair of curly
    braces with arbitrary content, a non-bracketed LaTeX command or a
    non-bracketed character. It is otherwise similar to %c, and its group names
    also start with a lowercase C (such as in \g<c1>). The pattern for the %C
    placeholder currently uses two capturing groups: the first one captures the
    opening bracket, if present, and the second one captures the command
    argument. However, this could be changed in future point releases to
    address bugs, and it should not be relied on. It is better to refer to
    capturing groups by name when using the %c, %s, %r and %C placeholders.

    5. The %m string is replaced by a pattern that matches LaTeX command (or
    "macro") name.

    6. The %h, %n and %w strings are replaced with patterns that match optional
    white space: %h matches an arbitrary amount of horizontal white space
    (space or tab), including none; %n is similar to %h, but may also include
    at most one non-commented newline character (and an arbitrary number of
    lines composed solely of LaTeX comments); and %w is similar to %n, but may
    include an arbitrary number of newline characters instead of zero or one.
    Contrary to the % strings from point 3, %h, %n and %w are not capturing
    groups.

    7. Opening curly brackets that immediately precede letters d, e, i and s
    are escaped in order to deactivate fuzzy matching in the regex module.

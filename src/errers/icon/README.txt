The ERRERS icon and logo were created by the DRDC Science Visual Documentation
team. Janice Lang suggested the original idea, and Adison Rossiter designed it
using the Google Poppins font (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins). The
original is saved as errers.ai in Adobe Illustrator format, with a copy of the
icon exported to errers.png. The Makefile generates the errers.ico,
errers.icns, and errers32.png files from errers.png.
